# Usually a slash follows directly after a tilde, because tilde is
# mostly used in paths. Therefore this function automatically appends
# a slash after a tilde except for two cases:
# 1) the preceding character is not a whitespace (e.g. `git reset --hard HEAD~2`)
# 2) when pasting a command (the slash is already there)
