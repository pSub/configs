# This is a little script to manage wallpapers.
# The intended usage scenario is the following:
#   - Save all wallpapers in $BGPATH.
#   - Write the file names (relative to $BGPATH)
#     of the wallpapers that should be shown
#     in the file $BGACTIVE.
#   - Run this script.
#
# This script will launch inotify to watch changes
# on the file $BGACTIVE. If it detects changes the
# wallpapers are automatically changed.
#
# Multiple file names in $BGACTIVE are only possible
# (useful) if your setter program supports multiple
# wallpapers (commonly one wallpaper per monitor)
# in the following way
#
#    setter filename [filename, â€¦]

# Path to wallpaper images
BGPATH=$HOME/wallpapers

# Path to file with active wallpapers.
# One line per file name.
BGACTIVE=$BGPATH/current

# The program that sets the wallpaper.
# By default bgs (see http://s01.de/~tox/)
SETTER=bgs

# Adds first parameter as prefix to the lines of the second parameter
# therefore the second parameter must be a file.
addprefix(){
  for s in $(cat $2)
  do
    echo -n $1$s" "
  done
}

# Set wallpaper
setWallpaper(){
  $SETTER $(addprefix $BGPATH/ $BGACTIVE)
}

# Set initial wallpaper
setWallpaper

# Look for wallpaper changes and apply them
while inotifywait $BGACTIVE; do
  setWallpaper
done
