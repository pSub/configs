# This script creates two files. One containing the installed packages
# that where installed from the offical repositories and the other
# file contains a list of installed packages that originate from the AUR.

pacman -Qqe | grep -Fvx "$(pacman -Qqm)" > paclog && echo 'Created package list' || echo 'Failed creating package list'
pacman -Qqm > aurlog && echo 'Created aur package list' || echo 'Failed creating aur package list'
